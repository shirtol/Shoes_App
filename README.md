# Weekend Project Match Finding Game

## Description

This project was taken as part of AppleSeeds Bootcamp, and was my first CRUD project.

The project's main objective was creating a shoes shop catalog.

I used react router for page navigation and axios for API fetching.

Class and functional components have been used with sass as the main tool for styling.
